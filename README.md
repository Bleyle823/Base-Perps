# Introducing Base Perps: Perpetual Futures Trading Reimagined for Base

We're excited to launch Base Perps, a revolutionary mini app bringing perpetual futures trading directly to the Base ecosystem and Farcaster community. Our mission is simple: democratize access to crypto's most liquid and popular derivatives markets through an intuitive, social-first experience.
Why Base Perps?
Traditional perps platforms are built for professional traders, featuring complex interfaces that intimidate newcomers. Base Perps changes this with a streamlined, mobile-optimized design that makes perpetual futures accessible to everyone in the Base and Farcaster ecosystem.
What Are Perpetual Futures?
With perpetual contracts, you're not just trading tokens—you're positioning yourself on where you think the market is heading next. Unlike traditional futures, perps have no expiration date, giving you the flexibility to hold positions as long as your strategy demands.
Key Benefits:

Speculate: Trade on price movements without owning the underlying asset
Go Short: Profit from declining prices, unlike spot trading which only allows long positions
Leverage Up: Control larger positions with less capital, amplifying potential returns
Risk Management: Hedge your spot holdings against short-term volatility
